# UserAuthGraphql
This is a very simple way to create a graphql API !<br>
In this API you have protected routes and unprotected routes<br>
you are free to use it, I hope you enjoy it :)<br>


before running the project:<br>
    change db config /config/config.json<br>
    run mysql then create a database:<br>
        mysql command : CREATE DATABASE graphql;<br>
    make a dotenv file<br>

## ENV
PORT=3000<br>
ACCES_TOKEN_SECRET= Generate a random token secret !

## Install dependencies
npm i

## Now you can run it !
npm start

## Note
It's my first graphql API, maybe not best practices used here...<br>
This is very simple to get started, but to use this in production you may need to adjust it !
